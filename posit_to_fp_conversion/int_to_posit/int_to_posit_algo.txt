Step 1: Create a 17-bit number of all 1s -> a
Step 2: Find LOD of input 8-bit integer -> n(position of leading 1)
Step 3: Left-Shift integer n times and then set MSB = 0.
Step 4: Logical AND with LSB bits of a.
Step 5: Left Shift a, n times.
Step 6: Create a result_posit variable of 16 bits with MSB = 0 and all 1s.
Step 7: Logical AND a[15:1] with result_posit[14:0].
Step 8: We now have the converted posit.
